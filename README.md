<h1> bayesian-network </h1>

Developed by Linjian Li, using Clion 2018.3.1

## Feature

  * Structural learning with complete data
    * Chow-Liu tree
  * Exact inference
    * Variable elimination

## Performance

### LIBSVM dataset "a1a"
As a benchmark, logistic regression and SVM implemented by me using Python both achieved accuracy of **0.83**. <br/>
My bayesian network achieved accuracy of **0.827626** using **Chow-Liu Tree** and **variable elimination inference**.

## blah blah

The directory "BayesianNetwork" is the project directory. <br/>
Need to run "a1a.config.generate.py" first to generate the configuration about "a1a".
